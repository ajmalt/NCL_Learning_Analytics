Write Main README file
Write data folder README file - add description of data (esp new frames)



Munging scripts
N.B. empty datasets will have all columns categorised as logical types - need to alter this, or not if there's no data?
ALL: add years in when merging datasets

1. Archetype data
a. determine whether the archetypes might need new IDs (we are going off student hashes though)

2. Enrollment data
a. Date columns to be converted from factors to dates: enrolled_at; unenrolled_at; fully_participated_at; purchased_statement_at.

3. Question-Reponse data
a. Integer columns to be converted to factors: week_number; step_number; question_number.
b. Factors to be converted to dates.

4. Step activity data
a. Convert number column and integer columns to factors: step; week_number; step_number.
b. Convert factor columns to dates: first_visited_at; last_completed_at.

5. Weekly sentiment data
a. Convert integer columns to factors: week_number; experience_rating.
b. Convert factor column to date: responded_at.

6. Team members
a. eliminate first_name and last_name columns (they contain nothing valuable due to anonymisation)


General data questions
1. What years are the data from? (see main PDF)



Questions from data exploration

Archetypes - initial questions
1. What are the archetypes mean and why are they interesting (from the archetype questionaire)? "Advancers", "Explorers", "Fixers", "Flourishers", "Hobbyists", "Other", "Vitalisers", "Preparers".
2. The "Preparers" archetype only appears in the 4th yesr's questionnaire and onwards. Was it introduced in Y4 or was it an option previously but with no one being categorised as such?

Enrollments
1. What does fully-participated_at mean?
2. What does purchased_statement_at mean?
3. Is country their nationality and detected_country where they are taking the course from?

Question-response data
1. Are these the same questions every year?
2. Why does the first yearâ€™s dataset have  different numbers?
3. Are these different questions or can they be compared with the other years?
4. Can the other years be compared at all? (Does it make any sense to merge them?)

Step activity
1. what is the significance of steps?
2. Why is the maximum number for each dataset 23, except the first, where it is 21?
3. does last_completed_at denote the closure of (a phase of) the course?

Weekly survey responses
1. 

Team members
1. Are these all the instructors on the course? If so, should this data be used to exclude certain people from analysis?
2. Is there any way to work out which instructor taught which students?
3. why are some team roles only there on certain years? 



Ideas for analysis
1. Archetype analysis - are certain archetypes more or less likely to drop out?
2. What causes the leaving rate to increase? Are there correlations between... archetypes? geographic areas? etc.?
3. Can the response rate be calculated? Will increasing/dcreasing response rates show us anything? Can the be correlated with satisfaction?
