# SOURCE CODE

This folder contains .R scripts that perform the initial explorations and analyses (some of these underlie the report). Refer to the notes below to see the **.R** file and its role.

- **archetypeExploration.R**: an early look at archetype data and some initial plots in an attempt to percieve patterns (across course runs). Nothing meaningful was discovered and this was rapidly abandoned.

- **enrollmentExploration.R**: an early exploration of the enrollment data via a few quick plots.

- **initialExploration.R**: initial exploration of the structure and content of the main datasets and source data files.

- **Presentation.R**: a script written that underlies the production of the slides in **Presentation.Rmd** (see README in 'reports' folder).

- **timeSeries.R**: a script written that underlies the production of the final report in **6_3 Final Report.Rmd** (see README in 'reports' folder).
